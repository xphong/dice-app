Android Dice App from 3 years ago. Uploading for reference.

## Description
Uses simple counter variables to store the sums of each dice roll, and the amount of turns the user takes. The sum and amount of turns is then stored into the SQLite database and saved. If statements were used to check if the user either wins or loses. AnimationDrawable was used to animate the dice rolling by looping through a set of GIF images. MediaPlayer was used to play the sound of a dice rolling every time a roll button is clicked on. Click listeners were used for each button, the number rolled is generated by Math.Random.
